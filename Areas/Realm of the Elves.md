More commonly known as Ilvern

Relatively untouched, by the claws of the modern age, this lush planet has a diverse eco-system of plants, animals, and fungi. To keep the planet in balance, any tech brought through the border, must be entirely self-sufficient, and cannot release byproducts of energy usage. To avoid contamination, there is a strict zero-tolerance policy, if any individual is caught breaching this particular set of rules, the tech is destroyed and the individual is exiled forever. Anyone found to cross the border, while exiled, is imprisoned in an unknown location.

Much is unknown about Ilvern, as the realm dwarfs the others (and the accessible parts of Bracklen), and the ban on tech leaves it hard to both explore and record the far corners.
