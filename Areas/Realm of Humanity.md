This hellscape was once the homeworld of a race of fierce creatures, until the day the gate to Earth was opened. Through decades of war, this race was killed off almost entirely, leaving a handful trapped on the dying rock that the earth had become.

The northern gate leads to [[Realm of the Elves]]
The eastern gate [[Realm of the crafty small ones]]
The sealed off souther gate [[Realm of Dragons]]
The western gate [[Realm of the curious small ones]]
