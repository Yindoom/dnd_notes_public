More commonly known as Bracklen, the homeworld of the Dwarves and Goblins

Dwarves live deep in the earth, mining for raw materials and food. The heat from the planets core allows for a special kind of farming, allowing these people to rarely, if ever, climb to the surface of the planet. 
They make use of designs and inventions discarded or dropped by the Goblins on the surface to dig further and improve their way of life.

Goblins live on the surface, basking in the light of the green sun. The harmful rays of the sun tends to turn the skin of anyone who spends enough time under it, a sickly shade of green, a symptom of something much worse. Due to this, Goblins who live in their homeworld, tend to have slightly lower life-expectancy, and their last few years are generally considered.. unpleasant. 
Along with this illness, middle-aged Goblins have a tendency to give into a certain kind of madness... or is it genius? 
Goblins buy materials from the Dwarves, to do their strange creations. To earn money to buy, they facilitate trade between the Citadel and the Underground
It is commonly known that a Goblin was the first creator of the motorised weapons used in the modern age. Elves, however, were the ones to bring the means to perfect them.
Goblin inhabitants of the [[Realm of Humanity]] retain their green skin. There is some strife between Bracklen inhabitants, and other Goblins, as Bracklen Goblins believe the ones who flee the sun to be cowards, unwilling to give their all in the name of progress.


## The Underground
The realm of the dwarves is the underground, and while the diversity has increased drastically since contact with the Citadel was established, the majority of its inhabitants are still dwarves, as they are uniquely qualified to be comfortable in the tunnels beneath the surface. 

Many centuries ago, the planet was left on the brink of poverty, as the resources in the underground were running out. That was, until inventors and researchers from the surface, the underground and the Citadel, all came together to find a solution. A solution that was uniquely suited to the way of life on Bracklen was found, and in the span of half a century, trade was able to slowly build back up. Currently there is a balance to the way of life of the dwarves.

Referring to the Underground as a single whole is misleading at best, as there are a multitude of essentially nomad communities. The tunnels are ever shifting, as old ones collapse, and new paths are built.

The one thing all of the different communes have in common, is a need to move regularly. Some move every few years or so, while some wait up to 5 decades. Each way has their upsides and downsides, and are largely determined by each communes leadership. It was exceedingly rare that a commune changes their rotation times, as that could bring imbalance to their surroundings.

Upsides to moving frequently: Less impact on each area visited. Income is generally fairly consistent. 
Downsides:  Potentially less time for each area to recover, depending on how many other areas a tribe has claim to. Need for more areas to rotate between. 

Upsides to moving infrequently: Easier on the inhabitants. Less need for a multitude of claimed areas. More time for an area to recover.
Downsides: Higher environmental impact leaves more to be recovered. Income can vary greatly, as resources in an area become scarcer.
