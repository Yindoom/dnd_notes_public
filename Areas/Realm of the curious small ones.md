Halflings and Gnomes

Small planet, an average human adult would be able to walk from one pole to the other in about 2 days. To have a sufficiently diverse eco-system, most creatures on this planet are very small in nature. 
The two peoples have a friendly, almost symbiotic relationship. Halflings generally stick together in small farming villages, where Gnomes act as nomadic merchants.
